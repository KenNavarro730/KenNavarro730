I am 19 and go to school in Philadelphia. I read a lot of current ml-related research papers and implement code. I also enjoy understanding
theory heavily in the concepts that I implement in code. My approach for learning is to always understand the math behind why something works before moving on
to the implementation. Ever since covid in march of 2020 began I decided to dedicate hours of my day nearly everyday to this craft. I thoroughly enjoy it. Other
than that I workout, and watch netflix sometimes. But its mostly either something related to this, schoolwork, the gym, or a show.
I am going to keep 2 repositories(other than this one). One is related to deep learning implementation and the other is my classical machine learning work.
